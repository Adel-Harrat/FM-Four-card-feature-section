## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCss - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I recently acquired the skills to use CSS Grid in conjunction with Tailwind CSS. This involved mastering concepts such as `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-area`, `align-self` and `gap`. It was a fantastic opportunity to apply and strengthen my knowledge of CSS Grid. Additionally, I have been utilizing React's reusable components to enhance the efficiency and modularity of my code. Overall, this combination of technologies has been a perfect platform for me to practice and refine my CSS Grid skills.
